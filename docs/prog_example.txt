# example program for ctronome. You can play it back:
# ctronome -p prog_example.txt
#
# fields are separated by single space
# fields are:
# <tact count> <bpm> <bpt>

# base note can be omitted for both tact and bpt, in which case it will default to DEFAULT_BASE_NOTE (see src/defaults.h)
1 60 4 # means: 1 60/<DEFAULT_BASE_NOTE> 4/<DEFAULT_BASE_NOTE>

# if base note is omitted to either bpm or bpt, it will default to the one specified
1 60/4 4 # means: 1 60/4 4/4
1 60 4/5 # means: 1 60/5 4/5

1 60/4 4/4 # repeat tact once, 60 bpm, 1/4 base note, five beats per tact
2 60/4 4/8 # the tact base note length is calculated proportional to BPM; so int this example, the length of 1/8 note is half of 1/4 as specified by BPM

4 60/4 7/9 # some more interesting rhythmic pattern
1 70/4 4/4

3 60/5 5/4
2 60/7 5/4
