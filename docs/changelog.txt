v0.5.6
   - fixed compile-time warning in dsp.c:
	dsp.c:51:2: warning: too many arguments for format [-Wformat-extra-args]
   - minor documentation improvements

v0.5.5
   - Documentation update: running ctronome with pulseaudio (modern Ubuntu distributions etc)
     and some minor documentation touch-ups.
     NO change to the ctronome code, so no need to recompile and reinstall.

v0.5.4
   - fixed amd64 platform bug that caused ctronome to produce no sound on amd64 platform
     due to incorrect width of integers used in bitwise operations, thanks to Dmitry Kazarov
     http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=ports/170207

v0.5.3
   - added #include <stdlib.h> to routines.c also. Silly me, forgot to
     do that. Again, thanks to Martin for letting me know.

v0.5.2
   - included WAV samples digitally remastered by Martin Tarenskeen
     to be more pronounced and precise.
   - added #include <stdlib.h> to ctronome.c to eliminate compile-time
     warnings with newer (>4) GCC versions

v0.5.1
   - new parameter processing bug introduced in v0.5 fixed
   - some old bugs are fixed around parameter and program processing

v0.5
   - WAV format is detected, and DSP is set up accordingly
   - included 2 channel (stereo) wav format for those sound
     systems that do not support mono mode (see NOTES/README)
   - bugfix in parameter processing that caused bpm base note
     to be ignored

v0.4
   - dsp.c code cleanup, according to OSS Programmers Guide.
   - implemented some debug messages, mainly for DSP procedures

v0.3
   - fixed dsp pattern length setup that
     caused silence at certain bpm rates

v0.2
   - fixed possible segfault bug in argument processing 

   + it is now programmable
   + more configurable bpm and bpt parameters
      allowing to specify the base note for BPM and beat per tact
   + number of repetition can be specified via command-line

v0.1 first version. supports:
     30 < beat per minute < 250
     1 < beat per tact < 50 
     44100Hz 16bit mono WAV sound via /dev/dsp
