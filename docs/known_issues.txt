Known Issues
    - There seem to be systems that do not support mono mode, or at least
      ctronome is unable to set it up. According to a feedback which is very
      appreciated, Intel Corp. 82801DB AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 2) with
      kernel 2.4.26 "Intel ICH (i8xx), SiS 7012, NVidia nForce Audio or AMD
      768/811x" driver, has this situation. If you experience something like
      this, use the stereo wavs included.

    - Ubuntu 22.04 with pulseaudio DSP emulator (padsp):
      Error message: "ld.so: object '/usr/\788488LIB/pulseaudio/libpulsedsp.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored."

      The issue is with the bash script /usr/bin/padsp, which contains a bug.
      See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/2068940 for more details and workaround.
