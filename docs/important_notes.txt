Notes on ctronome:
   - Ctronome trusts timing on the sound card, by bulding and looping audio
     samples with appropriate length. It *seems* to be accurate enough for
     general practicing purposes.

   - I assume that the soundcard driver blocks the program if the dsp buffer
     is full. If it does not, please report me.

   - The format of the program file is not strictly checked, however I do
     not expect ctronome to segfault on a badly formed program.

   - I do *not* thoroughly check the format of WAV files, only a portion of
     the header (no. of channels, bits per sample, samplerate).
